# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-CNN
Designed and implemented a deep learning model to accurately detect and classify facial emotions.
## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a Facial Emotion Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is designed to detect and classify facial emotions accurately.

## Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a CNN model developed using TensorFlow/Keras.
Emotion Detection: Classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and more.
Real-Time Detection: Integrates with a webcam for real-time emotion detection using OpenCV.
High Accuracy: Achieved 92% on the FER-2013 dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization, augmentation, and balancing techniques.
